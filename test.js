//Js is a loosely typed programming language.
//It does not attach it's variables to a certain datatype.
//so if we create var a=10; later we can also do a="jishu" or a=true/false.
//Unlike other languages it is not strictly typed.
//undefined is a place holder for default variables created with var.
//not defined is when you will not declare your variable and try to access it.
