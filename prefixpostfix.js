let x=5
let y=x++
console.log(y)//it will print 5 because in postfix's case first js will paste the initial value of x in y which is 5
console.log(x)//and after than it will increase the value of x to x+1 which is 6

let a=9
let b=++a
console.log(a)//in case of prefix first it will increase the value of a to 10 
console.log(b)//so b will also become 10 in case of prefix
