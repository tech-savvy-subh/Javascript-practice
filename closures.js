//1st Example
function x(){
    var a=1;
    function y(){
       console.log(a); // A function bind within it's lexical environemnt is known as closure
       //a function bundled together with it's lexical scope forms a closure.
       //function y is bundled with the var of function x and has it's access to parents lexical scope 
    }
    y();

//2nd Example
function x(){
    var a=7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
    return y;
    }
var z=x();//after x is invoked everything related to x will be deleted from memory vars and all but now z contains the function y
console.log(z);//z has function y now so it can be used outside x
/*
    The above line will return Æ’ y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
*/
//Not only the function y but function y with it's lexical scope was returned inside var z. a point to remember
z();//It will print 7 but why and how? cause we know once x is invoked verything inside x will be deleeted right?
//When a function is return from another function it still maintains it's lexical scopes.
//so even if function x does not exist the function y will remember form where it came from and also it's lexical scope where var a was residing.

//3rd Example , The 2nd Code and 3rd one is exactly same but it's a cool way to write it with this syntax.
function x(){
    var a=7;
    return function y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
    }
var z=x();
console.log(z);
z();
//4thprogram
function x(){
    var a=7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a);//here it will print 100 because in the memory it does not indicate to the value of a but the reference of a
    }
    a=100;
    return y;
    }
var z=x();
console.log(z);
z();
//5th program
function a() {
    var b = 900;
    function x() {
        var a = 7;
        function y() {//closure has been formed with parent and parent's parent
            console.log(a, b);//Here it will print 7 and 900 because y will form a closure with lexical scope of function x and a both
        }
        y();
    }
    x();
}
a();

/* Basically the callback function in memory is attached with a timer right?
:But we know that the way JS Bheaves it basically will store the value of i also in memory and each time the for loop runs the 
value will be incremented in memory.
But the main issue here is the callback function is forming a closure with it's parent x's lexical scope.
so it remembers the reference to i and not the value of i and for variable type var it stores the same copy of i in memory just the value is incremeneted only.
unlike let which is block scoped and each time the for loop runs a separate copy/reference is stored in memory.
when the value of i becomes 6 the setTimout method will be invoked and 6 will be printed 5 times.

//each time i is getting passed in close and for loop runs it stores a separate value in memory.
//earlier it was referncing towards the same copy in memory
//by using the close function we are creating a separate copy of i/x in memory whenever setTimeout method is called.
//Simply you can say the callback function in setTimeout mehod will remember a different copy of i/x each time it is called.

//Interview questions
//what is a Closure in JS?
//:Closure is a combination of a function bundled together with it's lexical environment.
//:Each and every function has access to it's parent's variables or functions.
//So even if the fucntion is executed in some other scope not in it's oroginal scope it still remembers it's lexical environment.
function outest(){

        function inner(){
            console.log(a,b,c);//as a closure is already formed with outer and outest's lexical environment these 3 variables we can access
        }
        return inner;
    }
    return outer;
}
let a =100;//now what will be the output ?The output remains same as while trying to do console log it will try to find the value of a in it's local scope and if it is there it will return the value of it as it is already there in line 159
var close=outest()("hello world");//calling a function and another function inside it till outer function with a param passed
close();//callling inner function Output: 10,20,"hellow world"

/*
Over consumtion of memory 
The variables declared inside a closure are not garbage collected.
Too many closures can slow down your application. This is actually caused by duplication of code in the memory.

/*It is a program in the browser or the JS engine which frees up the unutilized memory.

So, the garbage collector in JS will check the unutilized variables and free up the memory which those variables consume.
